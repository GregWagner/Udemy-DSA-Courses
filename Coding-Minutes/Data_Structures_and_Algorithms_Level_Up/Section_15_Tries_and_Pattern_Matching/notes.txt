Tries (also called prefix tree)
Important DS for pattern matching problems
- generic tree like DS
- efficiennt information retrieval DS
- search in optimal time P(key length) but uses extra storage

Important operations
- insert a new word
- search for a given word

each node can have multiple children

Sample Problem - Prefix Trie
Given a list of strings and Q queries, each query containing a word,
you have to tell whether the word is contained in thee list or not.
word[] {"apple", "ape", "mango", "news", "mo"}
queries[] {"apple", "banna", "new", "mango"}

output = Yes, No, No, Yes

Brute force - O(n^2)
BST - O(log n)
Unordered map 
Trie O(n)
