Useful for array and string problems

There are 2 types of sliding window problems

Type 1 - Fixed window length k
The length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find something in the window such as
the maximum sum of all windows, or the maximum or median number of each window. Usually, we
need some kind of varaible to maintain the state of the window. Some are as simple as an 
integer or as complicated as some advanced data structure such as list, queue, or deque.

Type 2 - Two pointer + criteria
The window size is not fixed and usually it asks you to find the subarry that meets the critera.
For example, given an array of integers, find the number of subarrays whose sum is equal to a
target value.
