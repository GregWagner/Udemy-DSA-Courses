Topological Sorting

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) is a linear
ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex
U comes before v in the ordering. Topological sorting for a graph
is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

Sort by dependency

Application:
1) Scheduling jobs from the given dependencies amoung jobs
2) Instruction scheduling
3) Ordering of formulla cell evaluation when recompting formula values 
   in spreadsheets.
4) Logic synthesis
5) Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in make files,
   data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers
