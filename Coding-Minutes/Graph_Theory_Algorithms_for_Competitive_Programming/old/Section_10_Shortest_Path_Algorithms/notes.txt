Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)
1) BFS
    * Must be unweighted
2) Dijkstra's
    * Weighted Graphs
    * Greedy Algorithm
    * Doesn't wwork for graps with negative weight edges
    * Uses priority queue or set
3) Bellman Ford
    * Weighted Graphs
    * Works for graphs with negtive weight edges
    * Algorithm
        initialize distance array to infinity and dist[src] = 0\
        Relax (update) all edges v-1 times {most important}
        Negative weight cycle detection


All-Pairs Shortest Path
4) Floyd Warshall
    * Dynamic Programming based algorthm
    * Finds all pair shortest path
    * Shortest between all paris of vertiices
    * works with negative edges
    * Can detect negative cycles too with one extra set
    * DP based O(n^3)
