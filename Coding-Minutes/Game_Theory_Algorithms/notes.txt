Combinatorial Games
2-person games with 
  Perfect infomation
  No chance moves
  With a win or lose outcome
  Players play optimaly
  Alternating turns
  Finte set of positions

Impartial games 
Where the set of moves available from any given
position is the same for both players

Partizan Games
Where each player has a different set of 
possible moves from a given position
  i.e. chess

Normal/Misere Rule
Normal - Last player to move wins since other
  player can't move
Misere - Last player to move loses

Take away games
----------------
* 2 players
* Both play optimaly
* There are n stones in a pile
* A player can remove 1, 2, or 3 stones from pile
* Normal Rule

Example Backward induction - start with base
  case and build up solution (w = winning solution, l = losing)
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
  L  W  W  W  L  W  W  W  L  W  W   W   L   W   W   W   L
     1  2  3     1  2  3     1  2   3       1   2   3
  So n % 4 == 0 -> losing position

Take away games (Misere Rule)
-----------------------------
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18
  W  L  W  W  W  L  W  W  W  L 
  n % 4 == 1 -> losing position

  N/P positions
  P - position winning for previous player (W above)
  N - position winning for next player (L above)

  Terminal position - position with no legal move

  Steps to determine positions
  1) Mark all terminal positions as P-positions
  2) Mark all positions which can reach any P-position
      as N-positions
  3) Mark all position as P-Positions from which Where
      can only move to N-Position derived in step 2
  4) If no new positions are marked, break, otherwise
      go back to step 2.

  Empty and Divide
  ----------------
  There are 2 boxes, one contains m chips and the other contains n.
  This is denoted as (m, n) when m > 0 and n > 0.
  The 2 players alternate moving, where a move consists
     of emptying 1 box and dividing those chips between 
     the 2 boxes with at least 1 chip in each box. 
  The terminal position (1, 1) is unique.
  The last player to move wins.

    (1, 1) => l
    (1, 2) & (2, 1) => W
    (1, 3) => L

    (n % 2 == 0) || (m % 2 == 0) => W


The Game of Nim
---------------
The most famous take-away game is the game of Nim, played as followed:
There are 3 piles of chips containing x1, x2, x3 chips respectively.
(Piles of size 5, 7, and 9 make a good game). 2 players take turns
moving. Each move consits of selecting one of the piles and
removing chips from it. You may not remove chips from more than
1 pile in one turn, but from the pile you selected you may remove as many
chips as desired, from 1 to the whole pipe. The winner is the player
that removes the last chip.
Note: 
If 1 pile, just remove all chips and you win
If 2 piles, 
  if equal # of chips, the second player can just do what the
    first player did so it is a losing position
If 3 piles:
  If 2 piles are zero, it is a winning position since it is
   a 1 pile game
  If 0, n, x chips (where n != x) is a losing position
  If 2 piles are equal, it is a winning position since it can
    get to a 0, n, n game

Num-Sum
The nim-sum of non-negative integers is their addition without
carry in base 2 (i.e. XOR)
  12, 9 -> 1001
           1100
           ----
           0101
