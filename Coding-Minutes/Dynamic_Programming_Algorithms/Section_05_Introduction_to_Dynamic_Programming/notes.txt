DP = Recursion + Optimation:wq


Steps 
1) Form a state -> f(x, y, z...)
2) Form a recursive relation (also called Optimal Substructure)
3) Overlapping Subproblems
    Once a solution to something is found, there is no need to 
    solve it again and there are 2 ways to handle them:
    1) Tabulation 
        Fixed size/static
        Do not go to any state twice
    2) Memoization
        Saving a solution and reusing it when the same problem occurs

For example find the fibonacci number
    state if f(n) -> nth fibonacci number
    recursive relationship is:
        f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
