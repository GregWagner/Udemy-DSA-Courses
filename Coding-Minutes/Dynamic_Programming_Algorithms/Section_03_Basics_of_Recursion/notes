Recursion
A technique where the solution to a problem depends on 
solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Recursion = Principal of Mathematical Induction
1) Figure out the smalllest case
2) Always assumme the subproblem can be soolved
3) Solve the current problem assuming the subproblem
   soution exists
