Adjaceny List
    Make a list of neighbors for each node (a list of lists)
    0 => (1, 2, 3)
    1 => (0, 2)
    2 => (0, 1)
    3 => (0)

Adjacency Matrix
    0   1   2   3
0   1   0   1   0
1   1   1   0   0
2   1   1   0   0
3   1   0   1   0
Wastes space

Edge List
List of pairs or triplets
Edges = {0, 1}, {0, 3}, {0, 2}}

Implicit Graphs
    4-way or 8-way

Applications
------------
Shorest Paths
    Google maps for navigating shortest paths, computing flight time
